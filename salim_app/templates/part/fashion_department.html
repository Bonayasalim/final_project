                  Our training approach combines theoretical learning with hands-on practical experience to ensure a comprehensive understanding of ICT concepts and their real-world applications. We conduct two types of assessments:
                  <ol>1. Formative Assessment: Continuous evaluation to track your progress throughout the course.</ol>
                  <ol>2. Summative Assessment: Administered by accredited bodies such as CDAAC, NITA, and KNEC to validate your competencies.</ol>
                  After completing the training, trainees proceed to a three-month industrial attachment, where they gain valuable industry exposure and practical experience. Upon successful completion, trainees graduate, ready to take on the challenges of the technology field.
                  Whether you're looking to kickstart your ICT career or enhance your existing skills, we are here to guide and support you on your journey. Welcome to a learning environment where innovation meets opportunity.
